Implementations of the four parallel schemes
will be analysed and discussed here by focusing on
the scaling results of
the \individualoperation{} and \pairoperation{} methods.

For each of the \individualoperation{} and \pairoperation{} methods,
a speedup graph will be presented to evaluate the overall scalability
of the method when run with 512, 4096 and 32768 particles.
%
An expected time complexity of the method will be derived based on
the implementation outlined in
\SEC{sec:methodology:subsec:implementation}.

A detailed breakdown of the times for the total run time, the MPI time
and the calculation time for each system size will be presented.
%
An attempt will then be made to explain these results in terms of the
derived time complexity will be made, if possible.
