\subsection{Objectives}

In particular, we are interested in three distribution schemes:
A replicated distribution scheme,
a domain decomposed distribution scheme,
a systolic loop distribution scheme.
%
We will explore the implementation and optimization of these three schemes
along with their suitability for evaluating both long and short range forces.
%
These implementations will be evaluated on performance in terms of the
minimum time to solution.
%
As useful systems may be simulated with
fixed numbers of particles,
we are not particularly interested in the weak scaling performance of
the system.
%
As such, we will focus on strong scaling results for 4 system sizes:
$10^4$ particles, $10^5$ particles, $10^6$ particles and $10^7$ particles.
%
For each optimization performed or change made, it will be studied
in the context of these benchmarks.

We will focus as well on the errors produced by a particular approximation.
This will be done by comparing results to
a scheme using a direct solution of the equations of motion
where feasible.
%
For this, it may be necessary to perform calculations using several
different time steps to accurately judge the errors introduced.
%
However, as we are limited on time, it may not be possible to generate
reliable enough statistics to make any hard conclusions.
%
We may only compare implementations.
