## Introduction ##
What is a Molecular system?
Why is modelling molecular systems useful?
What modelling methods are there?

What is MD?
Why is MD useful?

What is the basic MD problem?
Why is truncation bad?
Why so we want to look at direct solutions?

What will we be doing here?

## Background ##
### MD ###
What exactly is an MD simulation?
What bits do we need to make a simulation?
What do we need to do with those bits to get data?
Why do we need the system to reach thermodynamic equilibrium?

What physical constraints does an MD simulation conform to?
Can we use these to tell anything about our simulation?
What does the conformance to these tell us about our simulation?
If it necessarily conforms to these, is it still a valid simulation?


### Equations Of Motion ###

What is a potential?
How do potentials differ for different systems?
What are the equations of motion for a 2-body potential?
What is the Velocity Verlet integration scheme?
What is the error in the VV scheme?
What is the time to solution for the VV scheme?
What time step do we need for the VV scheme?

What is the Lennard-Jones potential?
What is the LJ potential useful for?
What are the equations of motion for the LJ potential under VV?
How do these equations affect our time to solution?

What is the importance of the effective length of our potentials?
When we truncate our forces, what are the effects?
Where is this ok and where is it not ok?
When we shrink our system sizes, what are the effects?
What happens if we have periodic systems?



### Force Parallelization ###

Can we parallelize the force calculation?

What is the replicated data scheme?
What are the scaling challenges of replicated data?
Why are the scaling challenges of replicated data concerning for exascale?

What is the systolic loop scheme?
What are the scaling challenges of systolic loop?
Why are the scaling challenges of systolic loop concerning for exascale?


### Benchmarks ###

What should we be measuring?
What will we measure?
How will we measure these?
Will we measure IO?
How accurate will the benchmarked simulations be?

### Implementation ###

What does an implementation look like?


How do the initial implementations perform?
