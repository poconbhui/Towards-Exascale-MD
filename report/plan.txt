## Introduction ##
Introduce Molecular systems.

Introduce usefulness of MD.
Introduce very basic problem

Introduce what we will be doing here.

## Background ##
### MD ###
What exactly is an MD simulation?
What bits do we need to make a simulation?
What do we need to do with those bits to get data?

What physical constraints does an MD simulation conform to?
Can we use these to tell anything about our simulation?
What does the conformance to these tell us about our simulation?
If it necessarily conforms to these, is it still a valid simulation?


### Equations Of Motion ###

What is a potential?
How do potentials differ for different systems?
What is the Lennard-Jones potential useful for?
What are the equations of motion for the LJ potential?
How do these equations affect our time to solution?

What is the importance of the effective length of our potentials?
When we truncate our forces, what are the effects?
Where is this ok and where is it not ok?
When we shrink our system sizes, what are the effects?
What happens if we have periodic systems?


#### Approximations and Sensitivity ####

Where can we cut corners?
How small can a time step be?
What do we actually have to evaluate for the forces?
What happens when we cut corners?
How sensitive are our results to these cuts?

If our chaotic system is wrong, why are results still useful?
If we know our system is wrong, why look at exact solutions?
Is it useful to study exact solutions to the 2-body potential?
Why not just take the approximation if we're already making approximations?



### Force Parallelization ###

Can we parallelize the force calculation?
Is it important for us to also distribute the data?
What are the benefits of the
  replicated, domain distributed and systolic loop schemes?
What are the drawbacks/limitations?

What benchmarks should we be performing?
How do the initial implementations perform?
