Exascale MD
-----------

This a dissertation project for the MSc. HPC in the University of Edinburgh run by EPCC.

This project aims to identify and address performance scaling issues of
currently used classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) algorithms.
It then aims to produce a simple, classical MD code capable of modelling
a system with improved weak scaling over the currently best model.
